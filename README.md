# lstm-wrapper
A command line user interface for running a Keras-based LSTM. Currently only parses csv.

Run `python main.py -p PATH -c COLUMN` from the command line, where PATH is the full path to a csv file and COLUMN is the name of the column in the csv that you wish to analyze.
(Note the column name can be changed later while the program is running)

Type `help` to see the available commands. After running the lstm, you can type `help` again to see lstm-specific commands.
